      <h2 id="h_1">Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assume that at least half of the website’s visitors arrive at a page through a path other than what you expected. </p>
      <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Users can arrive on a page via the parent page, a search engine, or any other page that directly links to it. Therefore, each page needs to independently address the questions "where am I?" and "what can I do here?" Additionally, each page title needs to be descriptive. This is particularly important because each title often becomes the link text used by other pages to take the user to that page (search engine included). Without a clear title, users won't know what to expect if they select that link. </p>

          <p><strong>Heading:</strong> "My immigration or citizenship application"</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> The above screenshots are all children pages of the main "Immigration and citizenship" page. However, this parent page chose not to match the exact title on the child page: </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-pass1e-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-pass1e-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a></div>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li><strong>Heading:</strong> "My immigration or citizenship application" <br>
              <strong>Link:</strong> "My application"</li>
            <li><strong>Heading:</strong> "Visit Canada" <br>
              <strong>Link:</strong> "Visit"</li>
            <li><strong>Heading:</strong> "Immigrate to Canada" <br>
              <strong>Link:</strong> "Immigrate"</li>
            <li><strong>Heading:</strong> "Work in Canada" <br>
              <strong>Link:</strong> "Work"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The "Immigration and citizenship" page only features the necessary keyword(s) in the link text, as its page heading already informs users what the context is. This creates a cleaner design of the parent page and allows for quick scanning, while still making sure the headings on the child pages meet the principle of front doors, should they be linked to from outside sources.</p>
          <p>This can be a good technique that maintains integrity of page titles, while not having to exactly match the link text on referring pages. That said, be careful not to strip too much out of the link text and verify that this approach works with your specific content and audience. The link must still be meaningful in order to pass the principle of choices.</p>
          <p>There is another point worth making in relation to the "Immigration and citizenship" page. While the link text and the uniqueness of categories make this an effective IA example, it's important to <strong>always consider whether the information provided on this page aligns with the mental model of its users</strong>. Would someone wanting to visit, study or work in Canada look for that information under "Immigration and citizenship" topic? If the answer is no, then this IA completely fails.</p>
          <p><strong>Remember: Each page needs to have a unique and descriptive page title, but the pages that point to it can adjust their link text, as appropriate. More importantly, always make sure the content reflects the needs and assumptions of your users. </strong></p>
        </li>
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-check-circle text-success fa-li"></span><span class="text-success">Passes:</span> Here is the Google search result for the keywords "income tax Canada". The first two links are very descriptive, which is excellent. </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-pass2a-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-pass2a-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>Search engines don't actually determine the page name from the page's title (heading 1 or H1) as it appears to the page visitors. They get it from the page’s metadata tag - a line of invisible code near the top of the page, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. In this case, the titles of the above two search results are: </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd wb-prettify">
            <li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;Income tax - Canada.ca&lt;/title&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;Personal income tax - Canada.ca&lt;/title&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Despite the " - Canada.ca" appearing in the links to these two pages, it's not in the <code>H1</code> of either page. This is because the <code>title</code> tag and the <code>H1</code> of the actual page strategically don't match. There is no need to add " - Canada.ca" to each page title, as it's already apparent you are on the Canada.ca site, given the "Government of Canada" graphic in the banner. Adding more content to the <code>title</code> tag helps the search engine users make informed choices to get to the Canada.ca site, while ensuring that users on the Canada.ca site don't get overloaded with unnecessary information. The differences are demonstrated below: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Income tax - Canada.ca </li>
            <li><strong>H1:</strong> Income tax</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-pass2b-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-pass2b-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Personal income tax - Canada.ca</li>
            <li><strong>H1: </strong>Personal income tax</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-pass2c-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-pass2c-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>You can view metadata of any page by right-clicking on a page and selecting "View page source".</p>
          <p><strong>Remember: Search engines use the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> metadata tag of a page to generate the link in search results. This allows you to add more or less information than what is in the <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> of the actual page. This can be a benefit to maximizing the user experience, if done correctly. </strong></p>

      <h3 id="h_2_2" class="text-danger">Failing examples</h3>
      <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Examples below are used for learning purposes to illustrate broken principles and their potential consequences, not to judge the organizations or people designing these interfaces.</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li class="mrgn-bttm-xl">
          <p><span class="fas fa-times-circle text-danger"></span><span class="text-danger"> Fails:</span> Here is the Canada.ca search result for the keyword &quot;France&quot;. The first two links are very descriptive, which is excellent.</p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail1a.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail1a.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>As mentioned above, search engines use a page's <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> metadata tag to generate the link in search results. In this case, the titles of the above two search results are: </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd wb-prettify">
            <li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;Travel Advice and Advisories for France&lt;/title&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="prettyprint">&lt;title&gt;Embassies and consulates | France&lt;/title&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The problem arises when you go to each of those two pages. Their page title (<code>H1</code>) doesn't match the title displayed in search results  (<code>title</code>). While page title and links to it don’t always have to match (as demonstrated in earlier example), it's usually safer to follow the general rule of having an exact match.</p>
          <p>When you allow for modifications, you can run into problems where both page titles  (<code>H1</code>s) are the same. This risks confusing the user, especially because neither one of these pages is the mainpage for everything Canada.ca has to say about France. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Travel Advice and Advisories for France </li>
            <li><strong>H1:</strong> France </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail1b-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail1b-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> Embassies and consulates | France </li>
            <li><strong>H1: </strong>France </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail1c-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail1c-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <p>Lastly, any other page wanting to create a link to these pages may misinterpret the scope of the page. If they create a link on their site called "France", it would give their users the impression that this is the Government of Canada's main page about France.</p>
          <p><strong>Remember:  Anytime you mismatch the <code>title</code> metadata and the page title
            (<code>H1</code>), you could create problems. Problems that become evident in search as well as on sites or pages that choose to directly link to your pages. </strong></p>

          <p><span class="fas fa-times-circle text-danger fa-li"></span><span class="text-danger">Fails:</span> Branded products often lose context when detached from a pre-dermined flow of information.</p>
          <p>For example, the primary application to view your personal taxes is "My Account". This broadly-named branded approach means a search for "my account" on Canada.ca produces undesirable results, as lots of pages have the words "my" and "account". </p>
          <div class="wb-lbx thumbnail mrgn-tp-md"> <a href="images/frontdoors-fail2-e.jpg"><img src="images/frontdoors-fail2-e.jpg" alt="Website screenshot" class="img-responsive" /> </a> </div>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li><strong>English search result</strong>: Although the "My Account - Help" and "My Account - What's new" pages make it into the top 10 search results, the main "My Account" page isn't there. "My account" is found on the <strong>second page</strong> of search results, as the third result. </li>
            <li><strong>French search result</strong>: The French branded term has better success in surfacing the link. <span lang="fr">"Mon dossier"</span> is found on the first page of search results, as the third result. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This means a user would have to go into a child page of "My Account" and then double back to the main page.</p>
          <p>Even if a user has more expert search skills and puts "my account" in quotation marks, which will search for the exact term, rather than 2 words separately, it won't retrieve only the CRA "My Account" as it also retrieves "My CFIA" account, creating opportunity for confusion. </p>
          <p><strong>Always be careful of branding products.</strong> If it's absolutely necessary, make sure it's descriptive and logical so it makes sense when accessed from different points of discovery. </p>
          <strong>Remember: Branded products may not resonate with the user, especially when they are featured out-of-context. Additionally, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/category-names-suck/

          <p>Of course, this isn't a problem if the user arrived on this page from its parent "Immigration and citizenship" page, but from Google's perspective, it looks like the Canada.ca's main page for everything a Canadian would need to know: </p>

            However, if the search engine or another page took them here, the user may think: "This is Step 2 Eligibility. Does that mean there is also a Step 1 Eligibility? Am I missing a section of information or is this the starting point for eligibility?" </p>

          <p>If this type of process is the right fit for your context and users, you would only index (let the search engine find) one page of the whole process - the landing page which starts with Step 1. This way, users will always start their journey at the beginning. </p>

          <p>Although features like expand/hide and tabs are an easy way to create a clean-looking page, it also means that content doesn't meet the principle of front doors because: </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>Users cannot link to specific content via email </li>
            <li>Users might have landed on this page because the search engine found their keywords on the page, but they don't see their keywords as most of the information is hidden </li>
            <li>Other pages cannot link to content within the expand/hide </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hiding information prevents users from finding it. Features like expand/hide and tabs are best used for peripheral content that you are OK with the user never noticing or finding. </p>
          <p><strong>Remember: The page design should not create barriers for content. </strong></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="h_3">Take aways</h2>
      <p> The goal of this principle is to ensure the content can be easily accessed by means other than navigating through the IA. In order to achieve this, you must ensure that: </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> page title is clear, unique and descriptive </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> page content is easily discoverable once the user lands on the page </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> page content can be linked to and shared with ease </li>
      </ul>
